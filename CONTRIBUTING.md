# Contributing Guidelines

We love improvements to our tools! EDGI has general [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to all of our organizational repos.

## Submitting Web Monitoring Issues

Issues that are project-wide, or relate heavily to the interaction between different components, should be added to our [Web Monitoring issue queue](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring/issues). Component-specific issues should be added to their respective repository.
